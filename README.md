# maisim

The game that has heavily from SEGA's Maimai and try to make it as a game that is powered by the community and can be play everywhere powered by osu!framework.

Note : The name is not final, it's just initial project name.

## Project Status

The project is just started and it's still in the very early stage. Currently want to make every element
on the Figma to the codebase and make it playable before go through the implementation on a lot of part
like UI adjustment, etc.

I also have a plan to develop a website so this game can be a full experience of rhythm game experience with addon of something
that Maimai cannot offer you.

I almost finished the design of the game on Figma. The Figma file is available on [project's wiki](https://github.com/HelloYeew/maisim/wiki/Figma-link).
