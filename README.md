# maisim

A free and open-source, community-powered clone of SEGA's Maimai game powered by the osu!framework

Note : project name isn't final (yet?).

## Project Status

The project is still in an infancy stage. Current priorities are creating UI pieces from the figma designs and getting basic gameplay working. Stuff like UI adjustment and etc. might come later.

There are plans to develop along this a website so the game can be a whole experience by itself, offering you things Maimai doesn't.

Figma designs are available at the [project's wiki](https://github.com/HelloYeew/maisim/wiki/Figma-link).

## Contributing


Want to contribute? Thats cool ! We got a lot of things to do at all scales :
- Got an idea ? Pitch it in a discussion !
- Want to improve the design ? Start a discussion about design improvements !
- Wanna contribute to implementing parts of the gameplay ? Let us know in a discussion thread !
- Found a bug or something not working as it should ? Open an issue to let us know !

Don't hesitate to make a discussion and we will try to answer as fast as we can.

You know C# ? You can try picking an issue up and make a pull request and we will review it.
